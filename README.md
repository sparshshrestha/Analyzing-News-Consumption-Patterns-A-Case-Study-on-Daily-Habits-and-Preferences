# Analyzing News Consumption Patterns: A Case Study on Daily Habits and Preferences

This repository contains R code and analysis for Case Study 2 of QMM1001. The study investigates the relationship between news consumption habits and daily activities, focusing on the behavior of Sparsh Shrestha over a period of 90 days.

## Overview

The analysis is divided into two main parts:

### Part 1: Influence of News on Daily Activities

- **Contingency Table Analysis**: Examines the relationship between watching news and consuming fruit.
- **Probability Rules**: Calculates probabilities such as not watching the news, watching news or eating an apple, eating an apple given watching news, and joint probabilities.
- **Disjoint Events**: Identifies disjoint events in the contingency table.
- **Independence of Events**: Tests whether watching news and eating an apple are independent events.

### Part 2: Comparison of News Watching Frequency

- **Population Proportion Comparison**: Compares Sparsh Shrestha's news watching frequency to the general population.
- **Standard Deviation and Mean Calculation**: Computes standard deviation and mean for the sample.
- **Sample Distribution**: Calculates the probability using the sample distribution.
- **Confidence Interval**: Establishes a confidence interval for the proportion of days Sparsh watches the news.
- **Hypothesis Testing**: Tests whether Sparsh's news watching behavior differs significantly from the general population.

## Conclusion

Based on the analysis, Sparsh Shrestha watches the news less frequently than the general Canadian population, as evidenced by statistical tests and confidence intervals.
